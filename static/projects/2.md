## Pokemon Objects Project

For our second project, we will be building a Pokemon analysis tool. Start by [downloading 
this data](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/armgilles/194bcff35001e7eb53a2a8b441e8b2c6/raw/92200bc0a673d5ce2110aaad4544ed6c4010f687/pokemon.csv) and read it into our program with an ifstream. 

Write a header and implementation file for a Pokemon object that stores the following: 
- name (string)
- types (list of strings)
- a method called print, that facilitates printing 


Write a header and implementation file for a Pokedex object that will store all 
of our Pokemon. Implement the following Pokedex methods:
- Pokemon getPoke(int id)
- Pokemon searchPoke(string name)
  - Performs a fuzzy sort on the Pokedex data for the name of the pokemon, this can be as simple or as complicated as youâ€™d like. 


Write a Main.cpp that contains some code to highlight the above features. Given I will be grading this code manually, 
this is a very freeform project, so don't feel pressured to do anything in a specific way. As long as your code matches the 
feature requirements laid out above, you'll get full credit.
