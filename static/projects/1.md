## Text Analysis Project

For your first project, weâ€™ll be building a text analysis tool that can receive input from stdin and print out some data about it. 

It will print out data such as: 
number of lines, words, and characters
number of vowels and consonants
number of even and odd length words


INPUT:
```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do. 
```

OUTPUT: 
```
lines: 1
words: 10
characters: 65 
vowels: 21
consonants: 31
even length: 4 
odd length: 6
``` 


STARTER CODE:
```
#include <iostream>
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    std::string line;

    while (std::getline(std::cin, line))
    {
        // process the line here
    }

    // print out data about the input
    return 0;
}

```
