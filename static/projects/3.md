Follow all of our established conventions when it comes to working with C++ objects (header files, organized file layouts, ec). 
Create a Creature class, give it the following private traits:
- `int age`
- `std::string name`
- `std::string state`
And he following public traits:
- `virtual std::string sayName()`
- `virtual std::string sayAge()`
- `virtual std::string getState()`
- `virtual void increaseAge()`

Creature is an abstract class, we are not meant to create instances of Creature. Create the following classes that inherit from Creature:
- TBH
  - constructor takes the following parameters
    - name
  - age initializes to 0
  - state initializes to "sane"
  - upon increasing this Creatures age, check if its age is divisible by 10
    - if true, set state to "tenner"
    - otherwise, set state to "sane"
  - implement the other virtual functions accordingly

- Human
  - constructor takes the following parameters
    - name
  - age initializes to 8
  - state initializes to "1:1"
  - upon increasing this Creatures age, check if its age is divisible by 5
    - if true, increase Human's age by 2
    - otherwise, increase by 1
  - implement the other virtual functions accordingly
