# Project 0

Remember, learning to program is much like learning a new language! You can't come to 
class twice a week, watch someone speak a foreign language, leave, and then expect to speak 
that same language. You need to go out of your way to immerse yourself to truly gain fluency. 

Project 0 is not a literal project, but a request from me to you to do the following:
- Try and set some time each day you don't have class to write some code, even 10 or 15 
minutes is fine. 
- The code you do write, should ideally *not* have any practical use. It can be a silly 
little whatever, but even that goes a long way into putting these ideas into your muscle memory
- Always be very conscious of exactly what it is your code is saying, when thing's 
aren't working, go through your code character by character. Often an extra or missing space, 
or maybe a flipped symbol is the issue. 
- **Test your code as you write it!** You should not be writing a bunch of code in 
one go, and then running it for the first time when you're done. We went over your 
developer environment in the first class, so you should be writing a little code, compiling, 
testing, and then writing a little bit more. Working in this style means that when any issue 
crops up, you know that it must have occured in the last few lines you wrote.
